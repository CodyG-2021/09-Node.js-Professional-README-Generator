## Installation

At the time of making this generator, it can only be made by copying the files to the project. 

## Usage

In order to use this project, one must download the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

Then open the terminal from the root of the files and type in "node index.js", then answer the questions to the best of your abilities. 

After all the questions have been answered the README will be generated to the output folder where it can be edited further.
